Either NexusMods doesn't allow files that are executables, or mine wouldn't scan for them for some reason.
The binary originally uploaded (now under "Optional Files") is flagged for "quarantine" and isn't available to be downloaded through the NexusMods site directly.

To view the utility's GitHub Repository with Documentation:
